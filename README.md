## Lab 1
### Goals
- Read Lab1 instructions (Lab1_S19.pdf) carefully. 
- Learn Command line, PostgreSQL, File operations, Gradiance.
### Command Line
- Windows/MacOS/Linux - CMD and Terminal
- Linux on Windows - Virtual Machines, like VMWare, Virtual Box, Linux on Window10.

- Common Unix/Linux Commands

### Introduction to PostgreSQL

#### Connect to PostgreSQL
##### SSH to Unix Timeshare (Recommend)

```
ssh 'yourCruzID'@unix.ucsc.edu
```
After connected to unix.ucsc.edu, you can use psql to connect to PostgreSQL. Replace with your CurzId and password recieved in your email.
```
psql -h cmps182-db.lt.ucsc.edu -U 'yourCurzId'
```
Then, you will see:
```
-bash-4.2$ psql -h cmps182-db.lt.ucsc.edu -U yourCruzId
Password for user yourCruzId:
psql (10.7)
Type "help" for help.

yourCruzId=#
```

##### Connect to PostgreSQL from local computers
Recommend operation systems: Linun/MacOS
Install PostgreSQL, tutorial can be found at https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Run command line from terminal
```
psql -h cmps182-db.lt.ucsc.edu -U 'yourCurzId'
```
##### change password
ALTER USER 'yourCurzId' WITH PASSWORD 'yourNewPassword';

##### Create your assignment file
On Unix timeshare, you can create a folder 'CMPS182', then step into CMPS182.
```
mkdir CMPS182
cd CMPS182
vim create.sql
```
Write your database commands in create.sql, for example
```
CREATE TABLE products (
 productID INT PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR(80),
 price DECIMAL(10,2),
 retailPrice DECIMAL(10,2) 
 ); 
```
What should we do for a primary key with multiple fields? See here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/ddl-constraints.html

It is highly recommend adding those lines in the top of your script. Since every time you test your script, it creates a new schema and tables. If those are already existed, PostgreSQL will not execute your commands.
```
DROP SCHEMA Lab1 CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA Lab1;
```

Follow instruction on Piazza -> Resources -> General Resources -> CMPS182_S19_GeneralInformation.pdf

All commands for Lab1 can be found in the above file.

### Gradiance
Follow the gradiance instruction on CMPS182_S19_GeneralInformation.pdf


## Lab 2

See load_data_lab2_v1.sql

Common questions:

- Change SEARCH_PATH to Lab2. Logout then login. 
```ALTER ROLE username SET SEARCH_PATH to Lab2Í¾```
- UNIQUE with composite attributes.
- Run SELECT queries inside psql.
